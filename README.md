# Particle Clock

A canvas / JavaScript particle clock. Uses native JavaScript to move particles around the screen, based on time. The script creates a number of randomly sized spherical particles, writes the time string to the canvas, copies the pixel positions of the text, clears the canvas, draws the particles (first time), and then tweens the position of the particles. It includes a few customizations via the options panel in the right top (jiggle the text, turn gradients on and off, and a Valentine's day specific theme - I wrote it the day before Valentine's day). Basically it'a pretty pointless, but a fun, experiment. Oh, and sorry about your CPU... the gradients make it tough on the ol' computer.
